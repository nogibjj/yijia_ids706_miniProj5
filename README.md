## CI/CD Badge

[![CI](https://github.com/nogibjj/yijia_ids706_miniProj5/actions/workflows/cicd.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nogibjj/yijia_ids706_miniProj5/actions/workflows/cicd.yml)

## File Structure

- **`.devcontainer/`**: Contains the development container configuration (`devcontainer.json` and a Dockerfile) to ensure a consistent development environment.
- **`Makefile`**: Provides commands for setup, testing, linting, and formatting the project.
- **`.github/workflows/`**: Contains CI/CD workflows for GitHub, which trigger actions like setup, linting, and testing when code is pushed to the repository.
- **`rdu-weather-history.csv`**: Contains weather data for the Durham region, used as the dataset for analysis.
- **`summary_report.md`**: A generated report with summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation), visualizations, and a comparison between Pandas and Polars for data analysis performance.

## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:nogibjj/yijia_ids706_miniProj3.git
```

### 2. Open the Repository in Visual Studio Code

- Reopen in the container using the .devcontainer configuration.
- Rebuild the container if necessary, ensuring Docker is running on your computer.

### 3. Install dependencies
Run the following command to install all required dependencies:

```bash
make install
```

## Usage
- make install: Installs dependencies specified in requirements.txt.
- make format: Formats Python files using Black.
- make lint: Lints Python files using Pylint, ignoring specific patterns.
- make test: Runs tests using pytest and generates a coverage report.
- make clean: Removes pytest cache.
- make generate_report: Generates a summary report in Markdown format that includes descriptive statistics, visualizations, and a Pandas vs Polars performance comparison using the profiler.

## CI/CD Setup
- Location: .github/workflows/
- Description: Contains GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD, which automatically run setup, lint, and test actions on pushes to the GitHub repository.

## Summary Report Generation
The CI/CD pipeline automatically generates a Markdown report using Polars to calculate summary statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation. It also generates a visualization from the dataset.

Additionally, the Profiler benchmark compares the performance of Pandas and Polars when running the same descriptive statistics tasks. The comparison is included in the report to provide insights into the performance benefits of Polars over Pandas.

The report is committed and pushed back to the repository, making it easily accessible for review and sharing.
